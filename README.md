Static marketing website for NYC Fintech Women, a community for women building careers and companies in fintech.

## Tech stack

- Plain HTML and CSS, built with [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- Shared styles in `src/site.css`
- Mobile-first, responsive layout

## Local development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev      # builds and serves with live reload
```

Then visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

`npm run build` writes the site to `_site/`, which is what Vercel deploys.
`_site/` is generated — never edit it, and never commit it.

### Verifying a change didn't break anything

```bash
npm test                   # post-file round trip, the seven committed posts,
                            # and the renderer's escaping and links
npm run verify             # compare the build against the pre-eleventy baseline
npm run verify:self-test   # confirm the check can still detect a change
```

`npm run verify` canonicalizes HTML before comparing, so the whitespace a
template engine reflows is ignored while real changes are still caught.

### Editing content

Most of what changes over time now lives in `src/_data/` as JSON, not markup:

| Change | File |
|---|---|
| Member count (appears on all 11 pages) | `site.json` |
| Where "Become a Member" points (50 links) | `site.json` |
| Team members, roles, LinkedIn links | `team.json` |
| Homepage hero copy, stats, why-join cards | `home.json` |
| Nav, drawer and footer links | `nav.json` |

Edit the JSON, run `npm run build`, done. The member count in particular is
written **once**: it feeds the hero, the animated counter, the partner stats,
the brand guide and every page's footer.

Two conventions worth knowing:

- `{memberCount}` inside a string is replaced with the current count, so
  taglines never restate the number.
- A link `href` of `{membershipUrl}` resolves to `site.membershipUrl`. JSON
  cannot interpolate, so data files reference site values by token.

> **Membership signup still lives on the old Wix site.** All 50 "Become a
> Member" links point there via `site.membershipUrl`. When the rebuild takes
> over the domain that URL dies, so a signup page has to exist here first —
> then change the one value in `site.json`. The Wix form is Wix-native, so its
> 18 fields and its submissions do not come across on their own.
- Fields rendered with `| safe` may contain HTML — the hero headline uses
  `<em>` and `<span class="underline">`. Everything else is escaped.

### Editing the navigation

The nav, mobile drawer and footer used to exist as 12 copy-pasted blocks. They
now live in [`src/_data/nav.json`](src/_data/nav.json) and render through
`src/_includes/`. **Change the nav in one place.**

Each page declares its own state in front matter:

```yaml
---
active: "chicago.html"    # which link is highlighted; omit for pages not in the nav
logo: "chi"               # nyc (default) | chi | sfo
selfPage: "events.html"   # links to this page become #anchors instead of reloads
---
```

`active` drives everything: the highlighted top-level link, its dropdown parent,
and which mobile drawer group starts open.

### Posts

All seven Fintech Female Fridays posts live in `src/posts/` as data. A post
file is front matter and nothing else: the metadata, an `intro`, and a `blocks`
list of `paragraph`, `heading`, `qa`, `quote`, `list` and `image` entries that
`lib/render-blocks.mjs` turns into the page. Eleventy writes each one to
`fff-<slug>.html`, where every inbound link already points.

Text in a block is the author's plain source, not HTML. Three inline markers
are understood — `**bold**`, `*italic*` and `[text](url)` — and the renderer
applies smart quotes and dashes on the way out. That pass is one-way, so never
paste rendered text back into a post file.

The six posts that used to live on Wix were imported from the HTML archive by
`tools/import-wix-post.mjs`, which is committed so the import can be rerun and
reviewed rather than taken on trust. It needs the archive at
`~/Desktop/Projects/wix-archive-nycfintechwomen/` and, for resizing the images
it pulls out, macOS `sips`:

```bash
node tools/import-wix-post.mjs --all            # rewrite every post file
node tools/import-wix-post.mjs --post mor-grisariu --dry-run
```

It overwrites `src/posts/`, so hand-edits to a post are lost on a rerun. Once
Wix is gone the tool has nothing to read and can go.

### Team member gradients

Each member in `team.json` carries an explicit `gradient` (`g1`–`g7`). Do not
compute it from position: the founders run `g1`–`g5` but the committee runs
`g6,g7,g1,g2,…`, so deriving it would silently restyle the page.

## Luma events integration

The **Upcoming** section of `events.html` is populated from a Luma calendar.

The Luma API key is scoped to an entire calendar and grants **full access** to
it — creating and cancelling events, reading guest lists. It can never be sent
to the browser, so `api/events.js` (a Vercel Function) is the only thing that
holds it. The browser calls `/api/events`, which returns a narrow allowlist of
public display fields.

### Setup

1. Get a key at `luma.com/calendar/manage/api-keys` (Settings → Developer).
   Requires a **Luma Plus** subscription on that calendar.
2. Local: `cp .env.example .env` and paste the key into `.env`. It is
   gitignored — never commit it.
3. Production: add `LUMA_API_KEY` in the Vercel dashboard under
   Settings → Environment Variables, then redeploy.

### Local development

`npm run dev` serves static files only and cannot run `/api`, so the events
section will show its fallback. To run the function locally use `vercel dev`
(Vercel CLI), which reads `.env` automatically.

### Behaviour

- Events are fetched at page load, sorted soonest-first, capped at 24.
- Private events are excluded; members-only events are shown and labelled.
- `geo_address_json.city` maps onto the New York / San Francisco / Chicago
  filter chips. Anything else appears only under "All cities".
- Responses are CDN-cached for 5 minutes (`s-maxage=300`) so traffic never
  approaches Luma's rate limit of 200 requests/minute per calendar.
- **If Luma is unreachable, unconfigured, or empty, the hardcoded events in
  `events.html` stay on the page.** That fallback is deliberate — edit those
  cards if you want a different safety net. Check the browser console for a
  `[events]` warning explaining which case was hit.

## Post editor

`admin/index.html` is a client-side authoring tool for Fintech Female Fridays
posts. There is no backend and no database: it opens a post file from
`src/posts/` and gives you one back.

> **It has to be served.** The editor imports the same ES modules the build
> renders with (`/lib/render-blocks.mjs`, `/lib/post-file.mjs`), so opening
> `src/admin/index.html` from disk no longer works — every import fails and the
> page tells you so. Run `npm run dev` and open
> [http://localhost:8080/admin/](http://localhost:8080/admin/) with the trailing
> slash, or use the deployed `/admin`.

To edit an existing post:

1. **Open post** → pick the file from `src/posts/`. The form and the preview
   fill in; a file it cannot read is refused with the line to fix, rather than
   half-loaded.
2. Edit, watching the live preview. The preview is the article body only — the
   hero, nav and footer come from the build.
3. **Download post file** → save `<slug>.html` back into `src/posts/`,
   overwriting the original. Eleventy publishes it as `fff-<slug>.html`.

A new post is the same minus step 1, plus **Download renamed image** → save it
into `src/images/` under the path the form shows. Then `npm run build` and check
the post, the listing page and the homepage.

**Nothing gets pasted.** The cards on `fintech-female-fridays.html` and the
homepage are generated from the post data, so adding a post to `src/posts/` is
all it takes to put it on both pages.

Drafts autosave to `localStorage`, so a reload won't lose work — but the image
file itself must be re-selected (only its path is stored). Use **Export JSON** to
move a draft between machines.

### Maintenance

The editor has no copy of anything. It imports `lib/render-blocks.mjs` for the
preview and `lib/post-file.mjs` for the file format, so a change to either is
picked up by the editor and the build at once — and the site nav, drawer and
footer live only in `src/_includes/`.

`admin/` is deployed but unlinked and has no password. `robots.txt` keeps it out
of search results; it does not make it private.

## Design

The site follows the v6 "Refresh" brand direction: pink-magenta and deep plum palette, Fraunces display type, and soft radial background washes. Design reference files live in `design/`.
